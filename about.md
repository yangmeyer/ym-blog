I make **products that help people get things done** in their work and personal life, and that are **nice to use**. There’s already enough crappy products in the world, and I don’t want to add to the pile.

For 5 years now, my professional focus has been Mac, iPhone and iPad apps. It is one of the finest platforms to create great software. And much like a musician’s “first” instrument, the Mac and iOS platforms allow me to put my passion into practice.

I’ve most recently worked as a **UX lead** and/or **iOS developer** on

- one of the world’s best banking apps for iPhone and iPad
- an iPad app that a luxury car maker uses in their showrooms

Currently I am launching **[Gemba](http://gemba.io)**, a **Mac** app that streamlines the asset delivery process between designers and developers.

## Freelance

I occasionally help select clients create world-class products as a **UX designer** and **Objective-C/Swift developer**.

My past projects have been for **established companies** in Germany and Sweden as well as for **promising startups** from Brooklyn to Brisbane.

> Currently available for contract work!

## Micropreneur

Over the years, my focus has shifted from creating good code to creating good user experiences and to creating good businesses. While good code and good UX are important, ultimately they rely on solid value propositions to be viable.

I’m aiming to **build a sustainable business** with my own products (like [Gemba](http://gemba.io)). Along the way, I share the joys and frustrations of running a **one-man product business** with my newly founded [meetup group in Frankfurt](http://www.meetup.com/Micropreneurs-am-Main-Frankfurt/).

Taking an app all the way – from idea and value proposition design, via interaction design and coding, to launching and marketing – has taught me immensely about how to produce high-quality apps that I can be proud of.

My earlier apps (circa 2012–13) are still available on the App Store and have been featured by Apple in Germany and elsewhere:

<blockquote style="margin-left:100px; font-size:1.0em;">“A wonderful app - intuitive interface”, “This really is an excellent App! Very useful”, “Works great and has a simple minimalistic design that I found very easy to use!”</blockquote>

## Global

I don’t call myself “cosmopolitan” or “polyglot” (how pretentious), but others sometimes do. Probably because I haven’t been good at deciding on where I want to live (ID/CN/DE/FR/US/SE) or remembering which languages I still actively speak (de/en/id/fr/sv/es?). Or maybe it’s because every now and again I surprise friends in SF, London or Bangkok with “hey I’m gonna be in your city next week got a sofa for me” e-mails. I’m currently based in **Frankfurt**.

## Interests

I like eating and speaking with the locals when [traveling](http://yangmeyer.de/suedamerika-blog/), enjoy the pensive simplicity of **week-long hikes**, play **ultimate frisbee** and sometimes I **brew beer**. I also appreciate fine typography and good coffee.

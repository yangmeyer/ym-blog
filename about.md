I make **products that help people get things done** in their work and personal life, and that are **nice to use**. There’s already enough crappy products in the world, and I don’t want to add to the pile.

Since January 2010, my professional focus has been Mac, iPhone and iPad apps. It is one of the finest platforms to create great software. And much like a musician’s “first” instrument, the Mac and iOS platforms allow me to put my passion into practice.

## Freelance UX

I help select clients create world-class products as a UX designer. I’ve most recently worked as a **UX lead** on

- [flinc](http://flinc.de), Germany’s leading ridesharing app for everyday rides
- one of the world’s best banking apps for iPhone and iPad

My past clients include **established companies** in Germany and Sweden as well as **promising startups** from Brooklyn to Brisbane.

## UX Workshops

I do custom-tailored workshops on **value proposition design**, **design thinking**, **lean UX**, **customer journey mapping**, and **user testing**. I have held workshops on these topics in Germany, Stockholm, and New York – in English, German, and Swedish.

## Products

Over the years, my focus has shifted from creating good code to creating good user experiences and to creating good businesses. While good code and good UX are important, ultimately they rely on solid value propositions to be viable.

I’m aiming to **build a sustainable business** with my own products. Along the way, I share the joys and frustrations of running a **one-man product business** with my founded [meetup group in Frankfurt](http://www.meetup.com/Micropreneurs-am-Main-Frankfurt/).

My most recent products address the **designer/developer collaboration** process. **[Gemba](http://gemba.io)** for Mac lets designers drag-and-drop assets straight into git repositories. **[Placeholders](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/placeholders-create-stand/id1042257116?mt=12&at=1000lbLJ&ct=ymblog)** lets developers create stand-in assets while they wait for pretty assets from their designers.

Taking an app all the way – from idea and value proposition design, via interaction design and coding, to launching and marketing – has taught me immensely. My earlier apps (circa 2012–13) have been featured by Apple and are still garnering 5-star reviews on the App Store:

<blockquote style="margin-left:100px; font-size:1.0em;">“A wonderful app - intuitive interface”, “This really is an excellent App! Very useful”, “Works great and has a simple minimalistic design that I found very easy to use!”</blockquote>

## Global

I don’t call myself “cosmopolitan” or “polyglot” (how pretentious), but others sometimes do. Probably because I haven’t been good at deciding on where I want to live (ID/CN/DE/FR/US/SE) or remembering which languages I still actively speak (de/en/id/fr/sv/es?). Or maybe it’s because every now and again I surprise friends in SF, London or Bangkok with “hey I’m gonna be in your city next week got a sofa for me” e-mails. I’m currently based in **Frankfurt**.

## Interests

I like eating and speaking with the locals when [traveling](http://yangmeyer.de/suedamerika-blog/), enjoy the pensive simplicity of **week-long hikes**, play **ultimate frisbee** and sometimes I **brew beer**. I also appreciate fine typography and good coffee.

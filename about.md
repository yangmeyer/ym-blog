## Hej!

I make **products that help people get things done** in their work and personal life, and that are **nice to use**. There’s already enough crap on the App Store and crappy products in the world, and I don’t want to add to the pile.

I’ve most recently worked as a **UX lead** and/or **iOS developer** on

- one of the world’s best banking apps for iPhone and iPad,
- an iPad app that a luxury car maker uses in their showrooms,
- my own products like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snip*-field-research-notebook/id568099336?mt=8">Snip*</a>, a note-taking app for iPhone that combines text, photo and audio snippets. (Apple totally stole my back button design for iOS&nbsp;7.)

Currently I am launching **[Gemba](http://gemba.io)**, a professional Mac app that streamlines the asset delivery process between designers and developers.

Since I started in 2008, I’ve created a number of other apps for myself and clients. Ask if you’re interested.

## Micropreneur

I’m aiming to build a sustainable side business with my own products. Along the way, I share the joys and frustrations of running a **one-man product business** with my newly founded [meetup group in Frankfurt](http://www.meetup.com/Micropreneurs-am-Main-Frankfurt/).

## The world is my oyster

I don’t call myself “cosmopolitan” or “polyglot” (how pretentious), but others sometimes do. Probably because I haven’t been good at deciding on where I want to live (ID/CN/DE/FR/US/SE) or remembering which languages I still actively speak (de/en/id/fr/sv/es?). Or maybe it’s because every now and again I surprise friends in SF, London or Bangkok with “hey I’m gonna be in your city next week got a sofa for me” e-mails.

I like eating and speaking with the locals when [traveling](http://yangmeyer.de/suedamerika-blog/), enjoy the pensive simplicity of **week-long hikes**, and play **ultimate frisbee**. I also appreciate fine typography and good coffee.

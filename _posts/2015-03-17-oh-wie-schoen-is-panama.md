After a few [“journeyman years”]({% post_url 2012-03-15-wanderjahre %}) in [New]({% post_url 2012-07-07-i-love-new-york %}) [York]({% post_url 2012-07-23-home %}) and [Stockholm](2013-11-21-stockholm), life has brought me back to Frankfurt, where my journey began.

Since I got back, it’s been wonderful to find a startup and indie community organically forming around [co-working spaces](http://www.die-zentrale-ffm.de) and [all kinds of meetup groups](http://usergroups.rheinmainrocks.de) (e.g. for [startup founders](http://www.meetup.com/Grunderstammtisch-Founders-Table-FrankfurtRheinMain/), [nighttime coders](http://www.meetup.com/Coding-Night-Frankfurt/), [CocoaHeads](http://cocoaheadsffm.github.io/cocoaheadsffm/)).

Over the past year, I’ve created [Gemba](http://gemba.io), a professional Mac app that streamlines the asset delivery/integration process between designers and developers: Designers drop assets into Gemba, which sanity-checks the assets for common problems, puts them in the right place, and pushes them to a Git repository.

While I worked on the product and the business all by myself, I received valuable advice, motivation, and inspiration from fellow [micropreneurs](http://changethis.com/manifesto/80.03.MicropreneurManifesto/pdf/80.03.MicropreneurManifesto.pdf).[^1] I didn’t find a suitable forum for sharing the joys and challenges of starting a sustainable “micro-business”, so I started [Micropreneurs am Main](http://www.meetup.com/Micropreneurs-am-Main-Frankfurt/). 30+ micropreneurs have already found the group, and I’m excited to meet some of them at our first meetup next week!

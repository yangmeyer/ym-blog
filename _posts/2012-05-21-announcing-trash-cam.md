**Because some photos aren’t worth keeping.**

Ever since I finally got an iPhone, I have found myself snapping pictures with its camera to quickly remember something. It’s a way of externalizing my memory:

* Instead of remembering where I parked my car in a 10-storey car park with color-and-number-coded areas, I just take a picture.
* Instead of remembering when I need to take the return bus back, I go to the bus stop across the street and just take a picture of the timetable.
* Instead of remembering where I left my bicycle, I take a picture of the street signs.

The thing is, these one-off pictures land in my Camera Roll. And from there, they get synced to my Mac and iPad, and they’ll probably still be there five years from now when I casually flick through my photos, lying there like **clutterring debris** among the beautiful and memorable personal photographs of family and friends.

So I built [Trash Cam](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id526535445), the App Store’s **first photography app for throwaway photos.** Its main features:

* The photos you take stay inside the app. They don’t clutter your Photo Stream.
* Trash Cam lets you keep exactly one photo. Trash it to take a new one.
* The photo is just one tap away from the home screen. Launch Trash Cam to see it.

Get it for [just 99¢ on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id526535445), and let me know what you think.

PS: Obviously I don’t expect to get rich and famous with this. But hey, I really wanted an app like this for myself, and so I just quickly made it. How great is that?

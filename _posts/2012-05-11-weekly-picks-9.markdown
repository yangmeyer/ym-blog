I have been reading The New Yorker ([$112/yr international](https://w1.buysub.com/loc/NYR/ATGFailsafeInt)) for almost a year now. I love the refreshing mix of serious world issues, cultural commentary, and comics. The issues arrive exactly a week late, so here is a small sampler from last week’s Talk of the Town section:

Picks from The New Yorker
-----
**[Vive la France](http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/05/07/120507taco_talk_gopnik)** // Adam Gopnik takes the French presidential elections as an opportunity to rebut perspicaciously how Europe is seen from America: “the tone about all this is oddly punitive here, as though the E.U. had been the product of some Brussels bureaucrat’s utopian folly rather than a miracle of coexistence wrought by a handful of quiet visionaries after more than fifty years of catastrophe.”

**[Food Groups](http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2012/05/07/120507ta_talk_mcgrath)** // On a decidedly lighter note, Ben McGrath reports on a lost-edited-and-found nonsensical children’s book “The Hare and the Pineapple” that originally was about a rabbit and <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">a tortoise</span> an eggplant. The New Yorker shows time and again that you don’t need to be serious all the time to be taken seriously.


Opportunity
-----
**[3 Years of Bootstrapping – Half a Million Dollars A Year Later - and 30×500, Redux](http://unicornfree.com/2012/3-years-of-bootstrapping-half-a-million-dollars-later-and-30x500-redux/)** // [Amy Hoy](https://twitter.com/#!/amyhoy)’s “30×500” class sounds like a wonderful idea. Promising no-nonsense lessons, intensive tutoring, and the benefits of the alumni network, 30×500 sounds like a [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com) of bootstrapped startups. (Alas, this year I am trying [my own way](/blog/2012/03/15/wanderjahre/) of finding what I want to do, or else I might have just joined.)

**[A Whole Other Country](http://willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2012/04/15/a-whole-other-country/)** // Will Wilkinson on radically pivoting his career: “we overestimate the value of what we already have and so underestimate the upside of taking a chance, leaving something behind, and making a big change.” (via [Ben Casnocha](http://casnocha.com/2012/04/the-upside-of-taking-a-chance.html))

App of the Week
-----
**[Brian Cox’s Wonders of the Universe](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brian-coxs-wonders-universe/id508465867?mt=8)** // [Chris Harris](https://twitter.com/#!/_chrisharris) demoed this iPad app at [Úll](http://ull.ie) and blew everyone away with the intuitive user interaction, fluid transitions, and his charming ad-hoc presentation style. His team built an amazingly powerful iPad editor to live-edit the images and transitions – exactly what Bret Victor was getting at with direct-feedback IDEs in [Inventing on Principle](http://vimeo.com/36579366).

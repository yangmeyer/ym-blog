Work and Ethics
--------------
**[Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html?_r=3&hp=&pagewanted=all)** // Greg Smith, who resigned today as an executive director of the firm, on recent developments in investment banking (corroborating the stories I heard from a retired chief investment officer). *J’accuse:* “My proudest moments in life […] have all come through hard work, with no shortcuts. Goldman Sachs today has become too much about shortcuts and not enough about achievement.”

**[Marlow in “Heart of Darkness”](http://log.scifihifi.com/post/18596743362/i-dont-like-work-no-man-does-but-i-like-what-is)** // “I don’t like work—no man does—but I like what is in the work,—the chance to find yourself. Your own reality—for yourself, not for others—what no other man can ever know.”

Doing and Making Things
----------------------
**[Pixel Union: Interview with Buzz Andersen](http://blog.pixelunion.net/post/18901900990/tumblin-buzz-andersen-director-of-mobile)** // “I think there are basically two poles of thought about design in the startup business: the Google School (where UX researchers and data wonks aspire to build minimalist, rationalist interfaces that adapt constantly to users) and the Apple School (where intuitive, perfectionistic auteur-visionaries are thought to produce gorgeous, perfect objects of desire users never even knew they wanted).” Not hard to guess where I stand on this question…

**[Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas ](http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html)** // Paul Graham: “Empirically, the way to do really big things seems to be to start with deceptively small things. Want to dominate microcomputer software? Start by writing a Basic interpreter for a machine with a few thousand users. Want to make the universal web site? Start by building a site for Harvard undergrads to stalk one another.”

**[A Precious Hour](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/02/29/a_precious_hour.html)** // “Each day I blocked off a precious hour to build something. Every day. One hour. No matter what.” ([@rands](https://twitter.com/#!/rands)) I did this November through December, and this extra hour of “work” actually boosted my energy instead of sapping it (and I’m quite happy with [the result](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id500560051)).

Society
-----------
**[How Changing Technology Affects Security ](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/03/how_changing_te.html)** // Bruce Schneier: “Changes in security systems can be slow. Society has to implement any new security technology as a group, which implies agreement and coordination and — in some instances — a lengthy bureaucratic procurement process. Meanwhile, an attacker can just use the new technology.”

App of the Week
--------------
**[Circadia](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/circadia/id489615659?mt=8)** // Delightfully novel game. Genius!

Favorite Longread
------
**[The Yankee Comandante – William Alexander Morgan in the Cuban Revolution](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/05/28/120528fa_fact_grann?currentPage=all)** (The New Yorker) // A portrayal of a man who, after many meandering years of soul-searching, found his calling in the Cuban Revolution, where he found purpose, friendship, and love. One of the most fascinating and heart-touching things I have read recently.

Society & Skin
------
**[Is This the End of Wall Street As They Knew It?](http://nymag.com/news/features/wall-street-2012-2/)** (New York Magazine, February) // I previously missed this interesting piece describing how the outrageously golden days of finance seem to be over.

**[Why Are Europeans White?](http://essays.backintyme.com/item/332)** // Fascinating explanation that comes down to two factors: Agriculture and the Gulf stream. Europe is exceptional because it’s warm enough to grow cereal (which lacks vitamin D) *and* it’s too far from the equator to receive enough sunlight (which allows the body to produce vitamin D) to offset the vitamin deficiency.

Technology
-----
**[The Mechanics and Meaning of That Ol’ Dial-Up Modem Sound](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-mechanics-and-meaning-of-that-ol-dial-up-modem-sound/257816/)** (The Atlantic, May) // Lots of interesting pieces in The Atlantic recently. This is one by Alexis Madrigal explaining the most iconic sound of the late nineties.

**[Please RT](http://nplusonemag.com/please-rt)** (n+1) // A fairly balanced (no pleonasm intended) exposé of what Twitter is about. If you’ve been scratching your head at why some people love it so much, read this.

Understanding Developers
----
**[Difference engine: Wired for speed](http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/06/super-star-programmers?fsrc=gn_ep)** (The Economist) // On super-star programmers: “The big difference is that the best coders keep more of what they have produced, while the worst constantly have to rework whole sections.”

**[The care and feeding of software engineers (or, why engineers are grumpy)](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/06/12/the-care-and-feeding-of-software-engineers-or-why-engineers-are-grumpy/)** // Everybody who deals with software engineers should read this essay by Nicholas C. Zakas. “Software engineers aren’t builders. Software engineers are creators. Building is what you do when you buy a piece of furniture from Ikea and get it home. […] Creating is a different process, it’s birthing something without direction or instruction.” 

New York

**[McCarren Park Pool Opening June 28](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/15/mccarren-park-pool-photos_n_1601097.html#slide=more233023)** // “Originally built in 1936, the pool was closed in 1984, only to be reopened in 2005 as a concert space graced with effervescent pool parties and musical performances.” – Yay! <span class="credit">// h/t [@charlesv](https://twitter.com/mugunthkumar/charlesv)</span>

App of the Week
-----
**[Matchbook](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/matchbook/id427740544?mt=8)** is a pretty app that lets me save cool places that I want to remember, like cafés, bars, shops, etc. I use it pretty much everyday – there are *that* many fabulous places around the town. (Free, with a very subtle, non-obnoxious advertising model – hats off to that!)

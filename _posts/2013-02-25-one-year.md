Today marks the one-year anniversary of this blog. Time to revisit the first year of what I hope will be a longer-lived blog than my previous attempts (circa 2002 and 2009, respectively).

## Favorite articles

I am particularly proud of the following posts:

* [Wanderjahre]({% post_url 2012-03-15-wanderjahre %}) – I announce that I quit my job, and philosophize about craftsmanship.
* [Empowering Infrastructure]({% post_url 2012-03-23-empowering-infrastructure %}) – why it’s great to be a developer these days.
* [Wabi-Sabi]({% post_url 2012-05-14-wabi-sabi %}) – on the traditional Japanese aesthetic.
* [Party Profile]({% post_url 2012-05-26-party-profile %}) – visualized data from my going-away party.
* [Alien Developer’s Guide to Moving to NYC]({% post_url 2012-06-19-alien-developers-guide-to-moving-to-nyc %}) – getting-started tips for apartment hunting, meeting people, work spaces.
* [Home]({% post_url 2012-07-23-home %}) – a personal ode to New York.
* [Creating Apps on the Beach]({% post_url 2013-02-25-creating-apps-on-the-beach %}) – insights into my app creation process.

## Frequency and word count

Taking the cue from [my last infographic]({% post_url 2012-05-26-party-profile %})’s popularity among friends and fellow nerds, I’ve created another visualization of the past year’s data.

*Rhythm and word counts of posts on this blog, over the past year. (Open image in new tab to enlarge.)*

The data clearly shows that the frequency of posts has declined notedly in the second half of this blog’s first year.

In part, this is because, by the summer, I fell behind and then eventually dropped the **Weekly Picks**, my roughly-regular roundup of links to interesting articles or apps. Although the Weekly Picks proved quite popular with my readers, I learned how much dedication it takes to commit to a regular publishing schedule – a commitment that I was not ready to make, and one that I now admire all the more in the bloggers and publishers of weekly or even daily publications who are.[^1]

Other reasons are the intense past few months – both professionally and personally – since my return from New York to Frankfurt in September, and a tendency of ever-longer posts.

## Outlook

I’ll go on record with resolving to publish **shorter posts, more often** in the second year of my blog. Perhaps something like 2–3 posts a month, and keeping them under a thousand words.

Also, in the next few months I intend to keep up the surprisingly regular rhythm of **publishing a new [app of my own](http://appstore.com/yangmeyer)** every few months.

**Stay tuned, and thanks for reading.**

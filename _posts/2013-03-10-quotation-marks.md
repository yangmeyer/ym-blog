My latest app is called *[Delighted! – “Great to meet you!”](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id607995866)*, or “Delighted!” in short. That is, in the English-language App Store.

For other languages, I decided that a more localized approach might give the app a more personal touch. So, while the name invariably begins with *Delighted!*, which serves as the main name of the app across languages, the latter part is localized.

These are the localized names that made it into the first release of “Delighted!”:

* Delighted! – “Great to meet you!” (English)
* Delighted! – „Schön Sie kennenzulernen!“ (German)
* Delighted! – « Enchanté ! » (French)
* Delighted! – «Mucho gusto!» (Spanish)
* Delighted! – “Muito prazer!” (Brazilian Portuguese)
* Delighted! –『认识你很高兴』(Simplified Chinese)
* Delighted! –『만나서 반가워요』(Korean)

Note how the **quotation marks, and their spacing** to the quoted text, differ between the languages. There is a fascinating Wikipedia entry on [non-English usage of quotation marks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark%2C_non-English_usage), on which I drew heavily.

I am not sure what happens in **App Stores without a corresponding metadata localization.** Do they fall back on “similar” localizations, e.g. if there is a (Portuguese) Portuguese but no Brazilian Portuguese, is the Portuguese-Portuguese displayed to Brazilian users? Similarly, if there is a Simplified Chinese version but no Traditional Chinese, will Taiwanese users see the Simplified Chinese localization? And does this fall-back go both ways?

Ultimately, though, I doubt that many users care about what some call [typographic “moronicities”](http://wordyenglish.com/musing/typography.html). I am not sure whether most «French-speaking Swiss» mind using the « French » localization. Also, maintaining a large number of localizations in iTunes Connect is a pain, to say the least. Therefore, although I strive to respect the different typographic traditions, I will probably keep it under a dozen variants.

This “localized naming” approach is, in the end, **an experiment.** I am eager to see how it goes.

As always, let me know your thoughts on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/yangmeyer), [App.net](http://alpha.app.net/yangmeyer), or by e-mail. Let me know if you think “Delighted!” should absolutely be localized to your favorite language, and I’ll see what I can do.

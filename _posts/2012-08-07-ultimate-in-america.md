Some observations from the past months in the New York ultimate scene and my last weekends at [Chowdafest](http://ripul.org/chowda/) in Rhode Island and [Wildwood](http://www.wildwoodultimate.com/) in New Jersey. The comparisons are to what I know from European ultimate.

The Ultimate scene
----
- More than one kind of “ultimate”: park games, pickup games, clubs.
- Much larger pickup scene, with all levels of play (casual park dabblers all the way to Nationals material) and different vibes (fun to committed).
- Players seem to feel more responsible for their own progress rather than externalizing responsibility to teams or coaches (small groups working out in the park).

The game
-----
- More athletic.
- More physical.
- More hucks.
- Less handlers – one dump is enough.
- Less inside-out passes, less hammers and knives.
- Less passes to the break side in general.

Tournaments
----
- No breaks between games at tournaments.
- No real lunch.
- No after-game spirit circle.
- Teams leave tournaments early, not bothering to play the last consolation game.
- Field lines (or end zone lines) not required – just cones.
- More enthusiastic sidelines.

Different but same same
------
Despite all these differences, it's still very recognizably the same sport:

- Same guiding spirit of the game.
- Same quirky bunch of people, notably modern-day hippies and CS nerds.
- Same gender dynamics (chauvinist points, guy defending a girl).
- Same apparel fashion style, same brands, same passion for bad-taste clothing.
- Same after-game games (street fighter, look up look down).
- Same quickness in deciding to settle a dispute with a game of roshambo.

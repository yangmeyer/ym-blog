My latest creation is out in the App Store. **[Snipster](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snipster-collect-+-arrange/id568099336)** for iPhone lets you collect and arrange snippets – text, voice, and photos. Anybody doing field research, construction site inspections, or any other on-the-go activity might find it useful.

Look Ma, no leather!

Snipster is dead-simple, no-nonsense, and [eschews skeuomorphism](http://skeu.it/).

About that last point. After having created a decidedly skeuomorphic app ([Memento](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id500560051)  with its wood panelling and corkboard), I wanted to experiment with an “honest” [flat design](http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/32267022219/flat-interface-design): flat colors or only the subtlest of gradients, geometric forms for icons, and a subdued color scheme. I hope you like it as much as I do.

If you’re a developer and are interested in my experiences while developing Snipster, [read my followup post](/blog/2012/10/18/some-observations-from-coding-snipster/).

Give it a spin

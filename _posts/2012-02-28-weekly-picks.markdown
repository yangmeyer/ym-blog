Starting this week, I will round up a handful or two of the links that have most inspired me during the past week. Subscribe to the feed if you’re interested.

**[Octopress – A blogging framework for hackers](http://octopress.org/)** // A highly opinionated blogging engine based on simple files, Markdown, Git, baked static pages, and Ruby. Matches my own preferences to the iota, so I just *had* to run my new blog on this engine.

**[Bret Victor – Inventing on Principle](http://vimeo.com/36579366)** (video) // Amazing talk with stunning examples of how to give creators instant feedback to allow for creative play ([@worrydream](http://twitter.com/worrydream)).

**[Right versus pragmatic](http://www.marco.org/2012/02/25/right-vs-pragmatic)** // Marco Arment (of Instapaper fame) on toilets, trash cans, and the media industry.

**[The cheapest way to discover if a startup idea will make money](http://maxkle.in/the-cheapest-way-to-discover-if-a-startup-idea-will-make-money)** // Interesting approach for validating ideas. In addition, it forces you to focus.

**[I Have No Idea](http://blog.mikeswanson.com/post/17160200980/i-have-no-idea)** // Mike Swanson, creator of comic-effect photography app [Halftone](http://itunes.apple.com/app/halftone/id419957803?ign-mpt=uo%3D5) , on going the extra mile: “Your exit criteria should be when you’re delighted to use your own app or feature and surprised that you were able to pull it off.”

**[Wir, die Netz-Kinder](http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2012-02/wir-die-netz-kinder/komplettansicht)** // A refreshing manifesto of our generation. ([English translation](http://pastebin.com/0xXV8k7k))

**[Optimizing for Happiness](http://speakerdeck.com/u/mojombo/p/optimizing-for-happiness)** (slides) // GitHub co-founder [@mojombo](http://twitter.com/mojombo) on the evolution of GitHub and its underlying values. Sure sounds like an inspiring and engaging place to work.

**Kickstarter projects** // I backed three wonderful projects today: [Matter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/readmatter/matter) (quality journalism), [Gremolata & Cancellaresca Milanese](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese) (making a new metal typeface), and [LowLine](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/855802805/lowline-an-underground-park-on-nycs-lower-east-sid) (an underground park on NYC’s Lower East Side).

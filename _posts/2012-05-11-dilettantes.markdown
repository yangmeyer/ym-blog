I’m really not a fan of picking other people’s hard work, mostly because I make things myself and know how hard it is to get things right. But seeing such **blatant typographic ignorance** from a signage-maker (of all things!) makes me cry inside:

![Is it Arial? Helvetica? Or \*gasp\* BOTH?](/images/in-posts/DRK-Helvetica-Arial.jpg)

*Yo,* sign-maker! You prefer Arial? that’s fine by me – tastes differ. But at least make your choice consciously. Know what you’re doing.

Oh, your client instructed you to install “the same Arial sign we have on the top roof“ on the lower building, and hey, they asked for Arial so they’ll get Arial, right? Wrong. It’s *your* **professional duty** to know better than your clients what they really want. *They* don’t need to be able to [tell Arial and Helvetica apart](http://www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsid.html) – but *you* as a sign-maker absolutely should.

And please don’t frickin mix-n-match Arial with Helvetica *ever* again. It hurts my eyes.

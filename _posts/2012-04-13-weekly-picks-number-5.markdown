I’m back from Catalunya — [beach ultimate](http://costabravatourney.com/) and delicious tapas — and a blissful Easter weekend in the hills and forests of Luxemburg. Quite a few interesting things happened during my absence, but see for yourself:

Instagram
------------
After only 551 days (!), Instagram [gets acquired by Facebook](http://blog.instagram.com/post/20785013897/instagram-facebook) for a reported one billion (!) dollars.

**[Inside Instagram: How Slowing Its Roll Put the Little Startup in the Fast Lane](http://gizmodo.com/5878942)** (Feb 2012) // Gizmodo portrayed the startup just two months ago: “Instagram isn’t just small; it’s tiny. It’s miniscule. (…) Instagram isn’t in Twitter’s old office, it’s in Twitter's old conference room. The entire company is nothing more than a collection of desks arranged bullpen-style in a room that is smaller than most two-car garages.”

**[Om Malik](http://gigaom.com/2012/04/09/here-is-why-did-facebook-bought-instagram/)** on why Instagram is so valuable for Facebook: “Instagram is all soul and emotion.”

**[Mat Honan](http://gizmodo.com/5900406/how-to-keep-facebook-from-ruining-instagram)** offers advice to Instagram’s new owners: “Don’t Make It Facebook”.

Business
-----------
**[Incremental Change Wins Apple Big Gains](http://tidbits.com/article/12856)** // Healthy mix of disruptive game-changers (original iPhone, original iPad) and regular incremental improvements. Allow long lifetime of products by allowing OS upgrades years after product release.

**[1 Startup, 2 Startups, Big Startups, Little Startup](http://ezliu.com/1-startup-2-startups-big-startups-little-startup/)** // You don’t have to become the next Facebook to be successful: “small expected value, small variance” VS. “big expected value, big variance”.

**[Caine’s Arcade](http://vimeo.com/40000072)** // A nine-year-old builds a cardboard arcade. He proves a great sense for pricing: 1$ lets you play four times, 2$ buys you a *hundred* times. Which would you choose?

**[Make Your Thing: 12 Point Program for Absolutely, Positively 1000% No-Fail Guaranteed Success](http://transom.org/?p=24153)** // Jesse Thorn on Transom with inspiring vignettes for each of his pieces of advice.

Dataviz
----------
**[Wind Map](http://hint.fm/wind/)** // Mesmerizing map of air currents in the USA.

**[Language communities of Twitter](http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/6277163176/)** (Oct 2011) // Twitter usage is the new [Earth at Night](http://maps.nationalgeographic.com/maps/print-collection/earth-at-night.html): You can clearly make out roads, coastal lines, and get a rough idea of technological progress. (via [Spatial Analysis](http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/2012/04/twitter-languages-london/))

**[Mapped: British, Spanish and Dutch Shipping 1750–1800](http://spatialanalysis.co.uk/2012/03/mapped-british-shipping-1750-1800/)** (Spatial Analysis) // Beautiful maps.

Culture
--------
**[Why don’t Americans walk more? The crisis of pedestrianism](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/walking/2012/04/why_don_t_americans_walk_more_the_crisis_of_pedestrianism_.single.html)** (Slate Magazine) // Great thought-provoking opener: “If we were to find ourselves out hiking on a forest trail and spied someone approaching at a distance, he wanted to know, would we think to ourselves, ’Here comes a pedestrian’?”

**[Real-time tweets from the Titanic](https://twitter.com/#!/TitanicRealTime)** // Follow on Twitter to experience a dreadful sense of foreboding. Currently on its third day out. Also: [People on Twitter Learn That The Titanic Was Not Just A Movie](http://laughingsquid.com/twitter-learns-the-titanic-was-not-just-a-movie/).

Design
--------
**[The of course principle of design](http://om.co/2012/04/05/the-of-course-principle-of-design/)** // Om Malik explains why “of course” is better than “wow!”.

**[500px / Terms of Service](http://500px.com/terms)** // “Basically, …” – all Terms of Service should be like this.

Programming
----------------
**[PHP: a fractal of bad design](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/)** // A few months ago a good friend urged me to continue developing our dormant PHP-based Facebook app. I felt almost physical pain at the prospect of grappling with both the [Facebook API](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/11/facebook-wins-worst-api-in-developer-survey/) and the subjective yuck of PHP. Now I can point my friend to [@eevee](https://twitter.com/#!/eevee)’s mind-boggling list of WTFs. (Absolutely [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) material.)

Apps of the Week
-----------
**[Drafts](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8)** (via [Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/2012/04/drafts-2/)) // I don’t like the visual design at all, but very much appreciate the thought that went into the interaction design. I’m tentatively replacing Mail with Drafts in my iPhone’s dock. Similarly, I find Readability prettier but prefer the [Instapaper](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8)’s no-nonsense UI — not to mention its [no-nonsense business model](http://brooksreview.net/2012/03/explanations/). Ultimately, [design is how it works](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/30/magazine/30IPOD.html?pagewanted=all).

**[Paper](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8])** (iPad) // Again, I agree [with Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/2012/04/paper-review-ish/) that “yes, Paper is overly simplistic in the UI design, but that is actually the point of the app — it’s meant to be a sheet of paper residing in a Moleskin *(sic)* notebook.” I admire how FiftyThree managed to make so much empty space not look empty but zen.

Wow, it’s already been a whole month since I arrived here. To mark the occasion, I brainstormed a (preliminary) list of things I love about New York.

<!-- more -->

- Everybody here seems to have moved to New York. Barely anybody grew up here. Making this overwhelmingly a city of **individual choice.**
- **Minorities** don’t exist because literally everybody is here. You are surrounded by, and interact with, people of all races, ages, faiths. There is a keen understanding that we all came here to live our lives.
- **Delis** serve good sandwiches and are just around the corner everywhere.
- The **pizza** is amazing. Large slices are sold everywhere. The chili flakes are good.
- The **subway** runs around the clock. Sometimes it’s hard to get a seat at 1 AM.
- **Anything** you want, from anywhere in the world – you’ll find it here. (Authentic Indonesian Padang food, Julius Echter beer from Würzburg, Brazilian guaraná, Polish candy, you name it.)
- Everybody here is **hustling**, moving forward, creating something, trying something new.
- **Failure** happens. Deal with it, and move on.
- There is a bustling culture of **indies and freelancers**, living today what journalists like to call the “future of work”. Coworking spaces and supportive communities abound.
- Easy to find good **beer** and good **coffee**.
- Summers are **real summers**. No anxiety about whether it will be a warm summer. They’re just always really, really hot.
- Wide sandy **beaches** reachable by subway. Beach ultimate every weekend.
- Beautiful **mosaic tiles** in all subway stations.
- Among the hundreds of people you see every single day, there are always some **beautiful** specimens of the human race.
- So many concerts, events, and activities are **free**. Plus so many opportunities to get free pizza and beer.
- Many **museums** of international renown are pay-what-you-want/can-afford.
- **Nobody cares** about what you do – except those who do.
- Shops are open on **Sundays**. It’s possible to buy beer on Independence Day – “*especially* on Independence Day!”
- The **rooftop culture.** Chilling, BBQing, sunbathing.
